# 🍍Coloring Pictures🍎

This mini-game involves coloring pictures as quickly as possible using codes sent by the author.  

The first two people to send screenshots of the finished coloring picture in the chat each receive your own rewards.  

If the picture extends beyond your screen, press \[ - \] to zoom out, or \[ + \] to zoom in.  
(**Tip**: *Zoom out until the picture is fully visible, then zoom in with your fingers if necessary.*)  

1. The color code in the cell (*e.g., 12*) must correspond to color 12 from the available palette (*example 1*).

2. If you see the color 6⥍2, for example, 6 is the primary color, and ⥍2 is the tint.
To open the tint palette, hold down the desired color with your finger and select the desired one from the available ones (*example 2*).

3. To insert the code, copy it from the admin in the clan chat and paste the code by clicking the \[ P \] button on the website (*example 3*).
